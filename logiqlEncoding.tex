\section{Encoding}
In order to solve the constraint system, we encode the constraints as Max-SAT problem and LogiQL language. 

\subsection{Max-SAT encoding}


\subsection{LogiQL encoding}
LogiQL is a declarative logic programming language ran by LogicBlox database system. Given a set of constraints from a particular type system, we can encode those constraints into LogiQL form, and solve them by LogicBlox.
\subsubsection{Basic Encoding} 
Basic encoding consists some predicates that won't depend on type systems.
\begin{lstlisting}
variable(v),hasvariableName(v:i)->int(i).
/*Variable is an entity type, and hasvariableName is a refmode predicate for it. A variable name is represented as a integer. */ 
\end{lstlisting}
This predicate stores all the variables(slotID-typeQualifier), which will be used for all other tables. 

\begin{lstlisting}
isAnnotated[v] = i -> variable(v), boolean(i).
/*isAnnotated is a functional predicate mapping variable entities to boolean values. Boolean value equals to true means the corresponding slot is annotated to corresponding annotation*/ 
\end{lstlisting}
This predicate represents whether the constraint variable v.slotID is annotated by v.typeQualifier.

\begin{lstlisting}
hasToBeTrue[v] = h -> variable(v), boolean(h).
\end{lstlisting}
This predicate is for the situation that a variable must be true, which is corresponding to equality constraint between a constant slot and a variable slot, a variable slot is supertype of the top type, or a variable slot is subtype of the bottom type.

\begin{lstlisting}
set_1_variable[v] = s -> variable(v), boolean(s).
set_1_variable[v] = true <- hasToBeTrue[v] = true.
\end{lstlisting}
set\_x\_variable means a group of variable, x is the number of variables in this set, the whole predicate would be true if one of variables in this set is true.

\begin{lstlisting}
implies1[v1,v2] = e -> variable(v1), variable(v2), boolean(e).
\end{lstlisting}
In the functional predicate impliesx, x means how many variables in the right hand side of implies logic. For example, implies1[1,3] = true, means "1 $->$ 3".

\begin{lstlisting}
rightSide[v] = r -> variable(v), boolean(r).
\end{lstlisting}
rightSide predicate indicates whether the right side of logic implies operated by logic negation.
